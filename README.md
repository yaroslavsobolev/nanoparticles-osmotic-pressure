# Osmotic pressure in cancer lysosomes
Calculations of osmotic pressure due to presence of charged nanoparticles in lysosomes of cancer cells

This code was developed and used for a research project described in a paper "Targeted crystallization of mixed-charge 
nanoparticles in lysosomes induces selective death of cancer cells", *Nature*, 2020. See this paper and the
corresponding Supplementary Information .pdf file for description of how this calculation is done.

```osmotic_pressure.py``` script contains the osmotic pressure calculation routines.

```tem_lysosome_sizes.py``` script analyzes size distribution of lysosomes from BioTEM images

```nps_per_lysosome.py``` and ```nps_per_lysosome.py``` scripts analyze and plot 
the distributions of the number of gold nanoparticles in cell lysosomes from BioTEM images. For calculation details,
see Supplementary Information .pdf file for the abovementioned paper (available from the Nature journal website).

The rest of the scripts are for miscellaneous plotting and illustrations used in this research article.
